# Project Humans vs. Zombies (Proj. 3)

### Student Info

-   Name: Philip Kalinowski
-   Section: 02

### Description

This project is a game based on humans vs. zombies. There is functionality for both game objects, where the zombies seek the humans and the humans flee in response.

### User Responsibilities

No user responsibilities. Just watch for the fun of it!

### Known Issues

Known issues include the map placement of zombies (exceeds planes of current, desired location). The zombies seem to become stuck and drive towards the origin without chasing all of the other humans. So, many humans escape into the corner and survive for another day. 

### Requirements not completed

Could not link zombies and humans as successfully as desired.


### Sources

No assets used from UNity, although a few videos helped me out as I coded with colliders.
